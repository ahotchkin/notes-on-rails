# Notes On Rails

Have you ever found yourself in a very important meeting, getting very important information, without a pen and paper in hand? It isn't long before the panic sets in and you realize you'll never remember all of the details, deliverables, and due dates being thrown around. Say goodbye to those stressful situations. Introducing Notes on Rails - a note-taking application where you can keep track of anything/everything you hear throughout the day.

As a user you can create an account, add notes, update notes as information changes, and delete notes when they are no longer needed.
